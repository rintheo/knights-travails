# Knight Travails
A script to find the shortest path a Knight can move from one point to another in a chess board. A small application of JavaScript data structures and their algorithms.

## Limitations
- Generating all possible solutions is hard-coded to be limited up to 6 steps as having no limits (such as having the knight cover the whole board in all possible ways) crashes the script due to memory limitations.

## To do
- Better implementation to effectively utilize data structures and algorithms.
- Optimize code
